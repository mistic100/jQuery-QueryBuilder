**Merge request checklist**

- [ ] I read the [guidelines for contributing](https://github.com/mistic100/jQuery-QueryBuilder/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] I created my branch from `dev` and I am issuing the PR to `dev`
- [ ] I didn't pushed the `dist` directory
- [ ] If it's a new feature, I added the necessary unit tests
- [ ] If it's a new language, I filled the `__locale` and `__author` fields
